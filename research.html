<br>
<ul>
<p style="line-height: 1.2; text-align: justify; width: 660px;">
I am a macroeconomist who studies the macro implications of micro level heterogeneity in both firms and households. 
My primary specializations are growth and household finance.
My endogenous growth research focuses on how and why firms choose to improve their productivity by investing in innovation and technology adoption. 
I study how these activities are influenced by the technological environment and policies, how they interact to determine the shape and time path of the productivity distribution, and how they contribute to aggregate growth.
My household finance research focuses on the dynamics of household wealth, income, and consumption over time and over the life cycle, 
using applied econometric techniques with micro survey data on both statistical and structural models. I am also interested in the finance and asset pricing implications of collateral constrained agents.

		Older wealthholders spend down assets much more slowly than predicted by classic life-cycle models. 
		This paper introduces health-dependent utility into a model with incomplete markets in which preferences for
		bequests, expenditures when in need of long-term care (LTC), and ordinary consumption combine with health and longevity uncertainty to explain saving behavior.
		To sharply identify motives, it develops strategic survey questions (SSQs) that elicit stated preferences. 
		The model is estimated using these SSQs and wealth data from the Vanguard Research Initiative. 
		The desire to self-insure against long-term-care risk explains a substantial fraction of the wealthholding of many older Americans.

	Older Americans, even those who are long retired, have strong willingness to work, especially in jobs with flexible schedules. For many, labor force participation near or after normal retirement age is limited more by a lack of acceptable job opportunities or low expectations about finding them than by unwillingness to work longer. This paper establishes these findings using an approach to identification based on strategic survey questions (SSQs), purpose-designed to complement behavioral data. These findings suggest that demand-side factors are important in explaining late-in-life labor market behavior and need to be considered in designing policies aimed at promoting working longer.

	There exists an extensive literature estimating idiosyncratic labor income processes. While a wide
	variety of models are estimated, GMM estimators are almost always used. We examine the validity
	of using likelihood based estimation in this context by comparing the small sample properties of a
	Bayesian estimator to those of GMM. Our baseline studies estimators of a commonly used simple
	earnings process. We extend our analysis to more complex environments, allowing for real world
	phenomena such as time varying and heterogeneous parameters, missing data, unbalanced panels,
	and non-normal errors. The Bayesian estimators are demonstrated to have favorable bias and efficiency properties.

		The least productive agents in an economy can be vital in generating
		growth by spurring technology diffusion. We develop an analytically
		tractable model in which growth is created as a positive externality
		from risk taking by firms at the bottom of the productivity distribution
		imitating more productive firms. Heterogeneous firms choose
		to produce or pay a cost and search within the economy to upgrade
		their technology. Sustained growth comes from the feedback between
		the endogenously determined distribution of productivity, as evolved
		from past search decisions, and an optimal, forward-looking search
		policy. The growth rate depends on characteristics of the productivity
		distribution, with a thicker-tailed distribution leading to more growth.

		Will fast growing emerging economies sustain rapid growth rates until they "catchup"
		to the technology frontier? Are there incentives for some developed countries to free-ride

		diffusion, with the productivity of imitation modeled by a catch-up function that
		increases with distance to the frontier. The resulting equilibrium is an endogenous segmentation
		between innovators and imitators, where imitating agents optimally choose to "catch-up"

		Using data on repurchase agreements by primary securities dealers, we show that three
		classes of securities (Treasury securities, securities issued by government-sponsored agencies,
		and mortgage-backed securities) can be formally ranked in terms of their collateral
		values in the general collateral (GC) market. We then show that GC repurchase agreement
		(repo) spreads across asset classes display jumps and significant temporal variation, especially
		at times of predictable liquidity needs, consistent with the "safe haven" properties of
		Treasury securities: These jumps are driven almost entirely by the behavior of the GC repo
		rates of Treasury securities. Estimating the "collateral rents" earned by owners of these securities,
		we find such rents to be sizable for Treasury securities and nearly zero for agency
		and mortgage-backed securities. Finally, we link collateral values to asset prices in a simple
		no-arbitrage framework and show that variations in collateral values explain a significant
		fraction of changes in short-term yield spreads but not those of longer-term spreads.
		Our results point to securities' role as collateral as a promising direction of research
		to improve understanding of the pricing of money market securities and their spreads.

	We study how opening to trade affects economic growth in a model where heterogeneous firms can adopt new technologies already in use by other firms in their home country. We characterize the growth rate using a summary statistic of the profit distribution&mdash;the mean-min ratio. Opening to trade increases the profit spread through increased export opportunities and foreign competition, induces more rapid technology adoption, and generates faster growth. Faster growth comes with costs: labor is reallocated away from production and fewer varieties are produced domestically. Quantitatively, these forces balance to produce large consumption-equivalent welfare gains from trade|especially along the transition path.

	We study how innovation and technology diffusion interact to endogenously determine the productivity distribution and generate aggregate growth. 
	We model firms that choose to innovate, adopt technology, or produce with their existing technology. Costly adoption creates a spread between the best and worst technologies concurrently used to produce similar goods. 
	The balance of adoption and innovation determines the shape of the distribution; innovation stretches the distribution, while adoption compresses it.	
	Whether and how innovation and diffusion contribute to aggregate growth depends on the support of the productivity distribution. 
	With finite support, the aggregate growth rate cannot exceed the maximum growth rate of innovators. Infinite support allows for ``latent growth'': extra growth from initial conditions or auxiliary stochastic processes. 
	While innovation drives long-run growth, changes in the adoption process can influence growth by affecting innovation incentives, either directly, through licensing excludable technologies, or indirectly, via the option value of adoption.

		 Data is nonrival: a person's location history, medical records, and driving data can be used by any number of firms simultaneously. 
		 Nonrivalry leads to increasing returns and implies an important role for market structure and property rights. 
		 Who should own data? What restrictions should apply to the use of data? We show that in equilibrium, firms may not adequately respect the privacy of consumers. 
		 But nonrivalry leads to other consequences that are less obvious. Because of nonrivalry, there may be large social gains to data being used broadly across firms, even in the presence of privacy considerations. 
		 Fearing creative destruction, firms may choose to hoard data they own, leading to the inefficient use of nonrival data. 
		 Instead, giving the data property rights to consumers can generate allocations that are close to optimal. 
		 Consumers balance their concerns for privacy against the economic gains that come from selling data to all interested parties.

	Individuals face significant late-in-life risks, prominently including the need for long-term care (LTC). Yet, they hold little long-term care insurance (LTCI). 
	In this paper we use a structural model and a purpose-designed dataset to understand the determinants of insurance demand. We distinguish between a fundamental lack of desire to insure, crowd out from existing insurance, and unmet demand due to poor products available in the market. 
	The model features individual-specific non-homothetic health-state-dependent preferences over normal consumption, consumption when in need of long-term care, and bequests, which are estimated using strategic survey questions. 
	To account for differences between the modeled and measured insurance products, we study not only individuals holdings of LTCI, but also their stated demand for an idealized product that mirrors that in the model.
	We find that many individuals would purchase LTCI and receive a large consumer surplus if it were a better product, while many others do not want to purchase even high-quality actuarially fair LTCI due to the values of their heterogeneous state-dependent preferences, their demographics, and their financial situation.

		This paper introduces the Vanguard Research Initiative (VRI), a new panel survey of
		wealthholders designed to yield high-quality measurements of a large sample of older Americans
		who arrive at retirement with significant financial assets. The VRI links survey data with a
		variety of administrative data from Vanguard. The survey features an account-by-account
		approach to asset measurement and a real-time feedback and correction mechanism that are
		shown to be highly successful in eliciting accurate measures of wealth. Specifically, the VRI data
		reflect unbiased and precise estimates of wealth when compared to administrative account data.
		The VRI sample has characteristics similar to populations meeting analogous wealth and Internet
		access eligibility conditions in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Survey of Consumer
		Finances (SCF). To illustrate the value of the VRI, the paper shows that the relationship between
		wealth and expected retirement date is very different in the VRI than in the HRS and SCF—
		mainly because those surveys have so few observations where wealth levels are high enough to
		finance substantial consumption during retirement.
